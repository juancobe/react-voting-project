Voting-Project 2017
===================

This is the 2017 implementation of [Tero Parvainen's](http://teropa.info/) Full Stack [Redux Tutorial](http://teropa.info/blog/2015/09/10/full-stack-redux-tutorial.html)

Major differences are present in the client, where create-react-app inclues a testing setup for unit tests that we are using (enzyme and Jest), instead of Tero's choice of Chai and Mocha.
